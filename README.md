# Planar-data-classification
In this notebook, I have built a neural network with multiple hidden layers to classify red and blue points in the form a flower.

This project is part of my deep learning specialization course from deeplearning.ai. 

**The key objectives in this notebook is to:**

  * Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
  * Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
  * Compute the cross entropy loss
  * Implement forward and backward propagation
